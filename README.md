<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
This is an infix to postfix converter implemented with C, Flex and Bison. For every infix expression the program calculates the postfix equivalent and the mathematical result.
</p>

<p>
The user can either input the infix expressions directly to the program or load them from a file. There are supported all the basic operands +, -, *, /, ^, %. But there
is not supported the unary minus. Also there are supported only integer numbres.
</p>

<h3>Compilation:</h3>

<p>
To compile the code, you just use the makefile by running: <br>
<code>make</code><br>
For this to work, the gcc compiler, the make, the flex and the bison programs have to be installed.
